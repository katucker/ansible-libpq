# Having the libpq role depend on the postgresql role (defaulting from Ansible Galaxy)
# ensures the desired version of PostgreSQL is installed prior to the tasks for building
# the libpq module.
# The postgresql role takes care of the complexity of installing
# the desired PostgreSQL repository version, regardless of whether that server is
# running a Debian or RedHat distribution OS.
# The development package is installed explicitly, since it is needed to build the
# libpq node module.
# The server package is installed by default by the postgresql role, but that can be
# overridden by setting the postgresql_server variable to False in a playbook's variables.
dependencies:
- role: postgresql
  postgresql_devel: True
